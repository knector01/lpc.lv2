lpc.lv2: LPC analysis + synthesis plugin for LV2

-- ABOUT --

Linear predictive coding (LPC) is an algorithm used to approximate audio
signals like human speech using an excitation signal and a filter to shape
the resulting sound. Because it can represent speech signals quite efficiently,
LPC has seen wide use in speech synthesis and audio compression. Additionally,
due to its distinctive sound, LPC has been used in popular music to create
robotic-sounding voice effects.

This plugin aims to serve that last use case by providing an LPC engine for
use in Linux-based DAW software. Most of the credit should go to Misra et al.,
the authors of rt_lpc; this project just provides an LV2 wrapper for their
engine.

For more information on LPC, I recommend reading the following pages:

-- INSTALLATION --

> make
> make install

The Makefile is set to place the plugin at the following path:
  ~/.lv2/lpc_plugin.lv2

-- PARAMETERS --

Order:
  The order of the filter created by the LPC engine. Higher values can
  approximate the original sound more closely. WARNING: if the order is set
  high enough, then loud resonances can show up. As a result, I recommend
  adding a peak limiter after this plugin in your DAW.

Whisper:
  Forces all audio to be treated as unpitched, which forces the excitation
  signal to always be noise. This creates a whisper-like effect.
  TODO: Add counterpart setting that forces unpitched signals to be pitched.

OLA:
  Enables/disables Overlap-Add (OLA) mode. Can improve audio quality but can
  also cause some dissonance when used with singing. Also increases the CPU
  load of the plugin significantly.
  TODO: Reduce the window overlap amount to avoid this dissonance. 

Glottal Pulse:
  Instead of using a pulse train for the LPC excitation signal, use a glottal
  sample. Can make the resulting audio sound slightly more realistic.

Preemphasis:
  Emphasizes the input signal using a high-pass filter prior to running the
  LPC analysis. Also de-emphasizes the signal output from the LPC synthesizer
  afterwards.

Pitch:
  Pitch-shifts the output audio up or down. Can create some neat effects.
  This setting does nothing if Whisper is enabled.
  TODO: Fix the overly large impact this setting has on the signal amplitude.
